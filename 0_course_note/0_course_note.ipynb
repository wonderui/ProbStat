In cluster sampling, we take a random sample of clusters, and use all the individuals within the selected clusters as our sample.

In stratified sampling, we choose a simple random sample from each stratum, and our sample consists of all these simple random samples put together.

    "* In **point estimation**, we estimate an unknown parameter using a single number that is calculated from the sample data.  \n",
    "> Based on sample results, we estimate that p, the proportion of all U.S. adults who are in favor of stricter gun control, is 0.6.\n",
    "* In **interval estimation**, we estimate an unknown parameter using an interval of values that is likely to contain the true value of that parameter (and state how confident we are that this interval indeed captures the true value of the parameter).  \n",
    "> Based on sample results, we are 95% confident that p, the proportion of U.S. adults who are in favor of stricter gun control, is between 0.57 and 0.63.\n",
    "* In **hypothesis testing**, we have some claim about the population, and we check whether or not the data obtained from the sample provide evidence against this claim.  \n",
    "> 1. It was claimed that among all U.S. adults, about half are in favor of stricter gun control and about half are against it. In a recent poll of a random sample of 1,200 U.S. adults, 60% were in favor of stricter gun control. This data, therefore, provides some evidence against the claim.  \n",
    "> 2. It is claimed that among drivers 18-23 years of age (our population) there is no relationship between drunk driving and gender. A roadside survey collected data from a random sample of 5,000 drivers and recorded,their gender and whether they were drunk. The collected data showed roughly the same percent of drunk drivers among males and among females. These data, therefore, do not give us any reason to reject the claim that drunk driving is not related to gender.  \n",
    "\n",
    "In Inference, the type of variable of interest (categorical or quantitative) will determine what population parameter we are going to do inference for.  \n",
    "* When the variable of interest is **categorical**, the population parameter that we will infer about is the **population proportion (p)** associated with that variable. For example, if we are interested in studying opinions about the death penalty among U.S. adults, and thus our variable of interest is \"death penalty (in favor/against),\" we'll choose a sample of U.S. adults and use the collected data to make an inference about p—the proportion of U.S. adults who support the death penalty.\n",
    "* When the variable of interest is **quantitative**, the population parameter that we infer about is the **population mean (μ)** associated with that variable. For example, if we are interested in studying the annual salaries in the population of teachers in a certain state, we'll choose a sample from that population and use the collected salary data to make an inference about μ, the mean annual salary of all teachers in that state.  \n",
